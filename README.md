# 🌗 Dark Mode/Light Mode Toggle Page

This project is a simple **Dark Mode Toggle** webpage built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to switch between **light mode** and **dark mode**, and their preference is saved using `localStorage`, so it persists even after refreshing the page.

## 📜 How It Works
1. When the page loads, it checks `localStorage` for a saved theme.
2. If "dark mode" was selected previously, the dark theme is automatically applied.
3. Clicking the **toggle button** switches between **light mode** and **dark mode**.
4. The theme choice is stored in `localStorage`, ensuring it remains even after a page refresh.
